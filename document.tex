\section{Failure}


\subsection{Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
	\item RUL $\rightarrow$ Remaining use of life, the remaining time the system can run before a failure.
	\item MTTF $\rightarrow$ Mean time to fail, the average between the start of the first failure and last among all of the systems.
	\item MTTR $\rightarrow$ Mean time to repair
	\item MTBF $\rightarrow$ Mean time between failure
\end{itemize}

MTBF = MTTF + MTTR
