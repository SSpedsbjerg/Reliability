\section{Failure}


\subsection{Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
	\item RUL $\rightarrow$ Remaining use of life, the remaining time the system can run before a failure.
	\item MTTF $\rightarrow$ Mean time to fail, the average between the start of the first failure and last among all of the systems.
	\item MTTR $\rightarrow$ Mean time to repair
	\item MTBF $\rightarrow$ Mean time between failure
\end{itemize}

MTBF = MTTF + MTTR

\section{Reliability Block Diagram}
Is bit like faulttree, but is more of an overview and doesn't go as far into depth, but more or less covers somewhat the same things. It is only describes whether something is functioning or not.
